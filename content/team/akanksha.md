Hi, I’m Akanksha, a People & Culture Specialist who loves creating workplaces where people feel valued, supported, and genuinely connected. I’m passionate about helping teams grow, fostering a sense of belonging, and bringing a little bit of joy and fun into the workday wherever I can.

I’m drawn to anything antique I find a quiet charm and story in things that have history. I also love coffee and exploring cozy cafes, and I often unwind with some good old Indian classical music. When I’m at home, you’ll usually find me tending to my plants  it’s my little way to slow down, reflect, and recharge.

I believe that work should be meaningful, collaborative, and human. I try to bring curiosity, empathy, and a friendly approach to everything I do, whether it’s connecting with team members, celebrating wins, or simply being there to listen. I hope to make every interaction thoughtful and warm.
