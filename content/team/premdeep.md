Passionate about scalable designs and building easy-to-use products, Premdeep's curiosity about why and how of things is what drives him to be a backend engineer. In his free time, Premdeep likes to tinker with RaspberryPi and Arduino.

He is a motorcyclist at heart. He believe nothing compares to the simple pleasure of a bike ride.
