Vignesh blends hands-on technical curiosity with a strategic, people-first approach, whether that's simplifying a process, or helping a team find the simplest path to impact. Outside work he’s a writer, self taught instrumentalist, amateur sportsperson and avid storyteller — you’ll find him screaming at a Barcelona match, tinkering with 100 tabs in the brain, or hunting down the next youtube channel for an obscure deepdive.
