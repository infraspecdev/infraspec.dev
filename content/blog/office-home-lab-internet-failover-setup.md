In this article, we demonstrate the fundamental steps to configure and set up the internet failover for office/home lab.

At our office, there is broadband connectivity, but it can sometimes be unreliable due to internet cut-offs at the ISP side or
due to bad weather conditions.
We also have our internal workloads running on Raspberry Pis, so it is important for us to get reliable and resilient
internet connectivity to run efficiently.
\
\
Internet downtime caused interruptions in our work and had to get one another broadband connection.
We've now got two connections set up, so if one goes down we can just manually switch it back. However, this does 
require some manual effort.
\
\
To ensure internet reliability, we need a cost-effective way where if the primary connection goes down, it could auto-switch (or failover)
to the secondary backup connection and restores back to the primary connection once it regains its connectivity.

>**TL;DR**: In a failover setup, failover is the process of switching to a secondary Internet connection when the 
primary connection fails or becomes unavailable. This can help to reduce the interruption of your work 
and keep your business running smoothly.

# Overview

- Two ISP connections (primary and secondary)
- Failover setup (not load balancing)
- Quick switching time between ISPs
- Clients should be part of a single network (IPs allocated from a single DHCP server)

# Setup failover

Few routers provide the flexibility to configure individual Ethernet ports.
By default, out of all the available ports, either one/two is configured as the WAN port and the others are configured as LAN
ports. This allows you to connect your WAN connection to the WAN ports and use the remaining LAN ports to connect
devices on your office network. You can also configure the Ethernet ports in different ways, such as configuring
multiple ports as WAN ports for a multi-WAN setup.

This would allow you to connect a second Internet source, such as a second broadband modem
to the router and use it as a redundant WAN connection. You can then configure the router to use both WAN connections
and switch between them if one of the connections fails. This can help to provide a more reliable and resilient
Internet connection for your Office/Home lab.

> **Note**: Not all routers allow the conversion of LAN ports to WAN ports. If your router does not have this option,
> you will need to use a different router or a network switch to create a WAN port. Some routers also come equipped with multiple WAN
> ports that can be used as well for failover in case one of the connections fails.

## Steps to setup internet failover
The steps to set up internet failover may vary depending on your specific setup and needs, but generally,
you will need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the primary and secondary internet connections that you will use for failover.
2. Configure your network router or network switch to use the primary internet connection as its default gateway.
3. Configure the secondary internet connection as a backup gateway in your router or switch.
4. Test the failover by disconnecting the primary internet connection and verifying that the secondary connection is used automatically.

## Configuration steps
### 1. Getting a second WAN port:

- We need to convert one of the LAN port to a WAN port (if we do not have 2 WAN ports in a router) as we need two internet sources.
- By default, the LAN ports are configured as a single network, with all the ports being part of a single bridge.
- Log in to the router's web-based configuration page. This can typically be done by entering
the router's IP address (such as `192.168.1.1`) in a web browser.
- Once you have accessed the router's configuration page, look for a section on bridging or port forwarding. From here,
you should be able to remove the port from the bridge by selecting the port and choosing the option to remove it.
Now this second port (eth2 in our case) can be used as another WAN port.

Now that we have two WAN ports/interfaces (eth1 & eth2) ready to act as our internet sources, the next step is to configure DHCP Clients for these ports.

### 2. Setting up DHCP Client:

- Plug in the ISP cables to both the WAN interfaces.
- Log in to the router's web-based configuration page and go to the network settings.
- From there, Enable the DHCP client and configure the network settings.
- After the DHCP client has been configured, the device should be able to automatically obtain an IP address
from the DHCP server on the network.

### 3. Configure the default routes and routes distance

- Access the router's configuration settings by logging in with the appropriate credentials.
- Find the settings for the routing table, which is typically found in the advanced settings or network
settings section of the router's configuration page.
- Check the default configured static routes, else create two default routes for the primary and the secondary internet connection.
Then configure the gateway address and WAN interface to it.
- Specify the route distance for each WAN connection by assigning a value to each WAN connection. The lower the value,
the higher the priority of the connection. For example, if you have two WAN connections, you might assign a value of
"1" to the primary connection and a value of "2" to the secondary connection. This will ensure that the primary
connection is used whenever possible, and the secondary connection is only used if the primary connection is 
unavailable.

### 4. Setting up the DHCP Server

- The goal here is to provide uninterrupted connection to the clients.
- Instead of using the ISPâ€™s DHCP servers (both will provide different IPs from different pools), we will be setting up
our own DHCP server which will be providing IPs from a single IP pool.
- This DHCP server will be assigning IPs to all the clients connected to the LAN bridge.
Till now all the connections are wired, and we need to provide a wireless access point to which the clients (devices)
will be able to connect wireless. The Access Point is connected to one of the LAN ports and since it is part of the
bridge network, all the devices connected via access point will be assigned the IP from our DHCP server instead of ISPs.

### 5. Testing our setup

- Although there are a lot of tools available to simulate network failures, we chose a simpler approach to test 
the working of our setup.
- Router provides us with the capability to disable the physical ethernet interfaces. 
To simulate the network failure on the primary ISP, we disabled the ethernet port.  Within a few seconds, we should
see the secondary/ failover connection kick in and the internet traffic flowing through it.
- Once we enable the primary connection port again, we should see that the traffic again is directed through 
the primary ISP.

## Conclusion
In this articles, We took an overview on how to go about setting up the office/home lab internet failover connection. We discussed configuring
WAN interface, setting and configuring the DHCP client and server, and finally we looked at testing our setup.
