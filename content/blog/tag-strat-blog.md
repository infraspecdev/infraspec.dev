## Introduction

Managing cloud resources efficiently in AWS requires a robust tagging strategy. Tags are key-value pairs attached to resources, providing crucial metadata for resource management, cost allocation, security, and automation. This blog will guide you through defining mandatory and discretionary tags and establishing detection and enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance across your AWS environment.

## The Problem: Untracked Resources and Rising Costs

At Infraspec, we started noticing some major issues with how we were managing our AWS resources. We had several AWS accounts in use, but no tagging standards were enforced. This meant that anyone could create resources, and sometimes, these resources were left running long after they were needed. 

As a result, our cloud costs were steadily increasing each month, and we had no clear way to track who was responsible for which resources. Without any tags, it was impossible to tie costs back to specific teams or projects, leaving us in the dark about where our budget was really going. This lack of accountability was causing both operational and financial headaches.

## The Solution: Enforcing a Tagging Policy

Realizing that we needed a way to get things under control, we started exploring how AWS tags could help. By enforcing a tagging policy across all our AWS accounts, we could ensure that every resource was labeled with essential information like the owner, team, and environment.

But we didn’t stop there. To make sure everyone followed the rules, we implemented Service Control Policies (SCPs) that would block the creation of any resources that didn’t have the necessary tags. This added a layer of enforcement that gave us confidence that our tagging strategy would actually be used.

## The Importance of Tagging

Tags are instrumental in achieving several goals within your AWS environment:

- **Resource Identification**: Quickly locate and manage resources.
- **Cost Allocation**: Track spending and allocate costs to specific business units.
- **Security and Compliance**: Identify resources that need special security measures or compliance with regulations.
- **Automation**: Simplify management and automation tasks.

## Mandatory Tags: The Foundation of Your Tagging Strategy

Mandatory tags are essential for every AWS resource. They provide a baseline of information that is crucial for effective resource management and accountability. Here are some key mandatory tags and their purposes:

1. **Owner**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the owner or responsible team for the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `SecurityLead`, `Workload-1-Development-team`

2. **Team**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the organizational team responsible for the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Finance`, `Retail`, `API-1`, `DevOps`

3. **Environment**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the environment type where the resource is deployed.
   - **Sample Values**: `Sandbox`, `Dev`, `PreProd`, `QA`, `Prod`, `Testing`

4. **CostCenter**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the cost center associated with the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `FIN123`, `Retail-123`, `Sales-248`, `HR-333`

5. **DataClassification**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the sensitivity level of data handled by the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Public`, `Internal`, `Confidential`, `HighlyConfidential`

6. **Service**
   - **Purpose**: Defines the type of service or application associated with the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Microservice`, `Monolithic`

7. **ManagedBy**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates whether the resource is managed by Terraform or manually.
   - **Sample Values**: `Terraform`, `Manual`

8. **Compliance**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates if the resource complies with specific regulatory frameworks.
   - **Sample Values**: `N/A`, `NIST`, `HIPAA`, `GDPR`

## Discretionary Tags: Enhancing Flexibility

Discretionary tags are not required for every resource but are crucial for specific use cases. They provide additional layers of metadata that help manage resources more effectively.

1. **Version**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the version of the resource or application.
   - **Sample Values**: `v1.0`, `v2.1`, `v3.2`

2. **Backup**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the backup frequency or requirement for the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Daily`, `Weekly`, `Monthly`

3. **SLA**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the service-level agreement requirements for the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `99.9%`, `99.99%`

4. **Lifespan**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates the expected lifespan or retention period for the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `6 months`, `1 year`, `Indefinite`

5. **Region**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the AWS region where the resource is deployed.
   - **Sample Values**: `us-west-1`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-southeast-2`

## Additional Useful Tags

In addition to the mandatory and discretionary tags, the following tags provide further management capabilities:

1. **ServiceOwner**
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the operational team or individual responsible for the service associated with the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Front-end`, `Backend`, `Database`

2. **PointOfContact**
   - **Purpose**: Provides contact information for the primary point of contact related to the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `email@example.com`

3. **AccountName**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the name or identifier of the AWS account associated with the resource.
   - **Sample Values**: `Prod-Account`, `Dev-Account`

4. **SharedService**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates if the resource is part of a shared service environment.
   - **Sample Values**: `yes`, `no`

5. **RemoveAfterDate**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies the date when the resource should be removed or decommissioned.
   - **Sample Values**: `12/31/2024`

6. **Shutdown**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates if the resource can be automatically shut down during non-business hours.
   - **Sample Values**: `true`, `false`


## Enforcing Tagging Policies

To ensure compliance with your tagging strategy, establish detection and enforcement mechanisms:

1. **Automated Tagging**: Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools to automate the tagging process during resource creation.
2. **Tag Policies**: Implement AWS Organizations Tag Policies to enforce tagging standards across accounts.
3. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: Use SCPs to prevent actions on resources without mandatory tags.
4. **Compliance Audits**: Regularly audit resources to ensure they comply with the tagging policies. Automate this process where possible.

## Implementing Tagging Policies in AWS

### 1. **Enforcing Tagging Standards with AWS Organizations Tag Policies**

AWS Organizations allows you to create tag policies that enforce your tagging standards across all accounts in your organization. Here’s how to create a tag policy:

- **Step 1**: Navigate to AWS Organizations and select “Tag policies” from the sidebar.
- **Step 2**: Click “Create policy” and define your tag rules. For example, you can enforce that all resources must have the `ManagedBy` tag.

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "ManagedBy": {
      "tag_key": {
        "@@assign": "ManagedBy"
      },
      "tag_value": {
        "@@assign": [
          "Terraform",
          "Manual"
        ]
      },
      "enforced_for": {
        "@@assign": [
          "ec2:instance",
          "ec2:vpc",
          "ec2:natgateway",
          "ec2:route-table",
          "ec2:internet-gateway"
        ]
      }
    },
  }
}
```

- **Step 3**: Attach the policy to your organizational units (OUs) or accounts to enforce compliance.

### 2. **Using Service Control Policies (SCPs) to Block Non-Compliant Resources**

You can create SCPs in AWS Organizations to prevent the creation of resources without mandatory tags. Here’s an example policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "DenyEC2CreationWithNoManagedByTag",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": [
        "ec2:RunInstances",
        "ec2:CreateVpc",
        "ec2:CreateNatGateway",
        "ec2:CreateRouteTable",
        "ec2:CreateInternetGateway"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:vpc/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:natgateway/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:route-table/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:internet-gateway/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*"
      ],
      "Condition": {
        "Null": {
          "aws:RequestTag/ManagedBy": "true"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
## Tag Naming and Usage Conventions

To ensure consistency and avoid conflicts, adhere to the following conventions:

1. **Tag Limits**: Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags.
2. **Unique Tags**: Each tag key must be unique per resource, and each tag key can have only one value.
3. **Length Limits**: The maximum tag key length is 128 Unicode characters in UTF-8. The maximum tag value length is 256 Unicode characters in UTF-8.
4. **Allowed Characters**: Allowed characters are letters, numbers, spaces representable in UTF-8, and the following characters: `. : + = @ _ / -` (hyphen). Amazon EC2 resources allow any characters.
5. **Case Sensitivity**: Tag keys and values are case sensitive. Decide on a strategy for capitalizing tags and consistently implement that strategy across all resource types. For example, decide whether to use `Costcenter`, `costcenter`, or `CostCenter`, and use the same convention for all tags.
6. **AWS Prefix**: The `aws:` prefix is prohibited for tags; it's reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag keys or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per resource quota.

## Best Practices for Tagging

1. **Consistency**: Use a standardized format for tags to avoid discrepancies. Decide on conventions for capitalization and delimiters and stick to them.
2. **Automation**: Automate tagging to reduce manual errors and ensure compliance.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of your tagging strategy and dictionary for reference.
4. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Involve all relevant stakeholders in defining and reviewing the tagging strategy to ensure it meets organizational needs.

## The Impact: Accountability and Cost Control

Implementing this tagging strategy was a game-changer for us. We now had clear visibility into who was using what resources, and we could track our cloud costs with precision. This made it much easier to allocate expenses to the correct departments and projects, and we finally had the accountability we needed.

## Conclusion

A well-defined tagging strategy is essential for effective cloud resource management. By distinguishing between mandatory and discretionary tags and implementing robust enforcement mechanisms, you can achieve better visibility, cost control, and security in your AWS environment. Start by establishing a clear tagging dictionary and ensure compliance through automation and regular audits.
